# AWS S3 Security Standards and Compliance Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the mandatory security standards for Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) buckets across all environments. Compliance with these standards is required for SOC2, ISO 27001, and PCI-DSS certifications.

## Encryption Requirements

### Encryption at Rest
All S3 buckets MUST implement encryption at rest using one of the following methods:
- **AES-256**: Server-side encryption with S3-managed keys (SSE-S3)
- **KMS-CMK**: Server-side encryption with AWS KMS customer master keys (SSE-KMS)
- **Customer-Provided**: Server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C)

Policy ID: AWS-POL-S3-001
Compliance Level: Required
Audit Frequency: Quarterly

### Encryption in Transit
All data transfers to and from S3 buckets MUST use TLS 1.2 or higher. Bucket policies should enforce HTTPS-only access:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Deny",
  "Principal": "*",
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*",
  "Condition": {
    "Bool": {
      "aws:SecureTransport": "false"
    }
  }
}
```

## Access Control Requirements

### Bucket Policies
- Public access MUST be blocked at the account level
- Bucket ACLs should be disabled in favor of bucket policies
- Cross-account access requires explicit approval from Security team

### IAM Permissions
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Use IAM roles instead of IAM users where possible
- Implement MFA delete for production buckets

## Versioning and Lifecycle

### Versioning
Production buckets MUST have versioning enabled to:
- Protect against accidental deletion
- Enable point-in-time recovery
- Support compliance audit trails

### Lifecycle Policies
Implement lifecycle policies to:
- Transition objects to Glacier after 90 days
- Delete non-current versions after 180 days
- Remove incomplete multipart uploads after 7 days

## Logging and Monitoring

### Access Logging
Enable S3 access logging for all production buckets:
- Log destination must be a separate bucket
- Logs must be retained for minimum 1 year
- CloudTrail data events should be enabled

### CloudWatch Metrics
Monitor and alert on:
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Bucket size anomalies
- Request rate spikes
- 4xx and 5xx error rates

## Compliance Tags

All S3 buckets MUST have the following tags:
- Environment: [Production|Staging|Development]
- DataClassification: [Public|Internal|Confidential|Restricted]
- Owner: [Email address]
- CostCenter: [Department code]
- ComplianceScope: [SOC2|PCI|HIPAA|None]

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

### Cross-Region Replication
Critical data buckets must implement:
- Cross-region replication to at least one other region
- Replication time control (RTC) for 15-minute RPO
- Replication metrics and monitoring

### Backup Requirements
- Daily backups for Confidential and Restricted data
- Weekly backups for Internal data
- Backup retention: 30 days minimum

## Security Best Practices

### Additional Recommendations
1. Enable AWS Macie for sensitive data discovery
2. Use S3 Object Lock for compliance data
3. Implement S3 Inventory for regular audits
4. Enable GuardDuty for threat detection
5. Use VPC endpoints for private connectivity

## Audit and Compliance

### Quarterly Reviews
Security team will conduct quarterly reviews of:
- Bucket permissions and policies
- Encryption status
- Public access blocks
- Compliance tag accuracy
- Access patterns and anomalies

### Remediation Timeline
- Critical findings: 24 hours
- High findings: 7 days
- Medium findings: 30 days
- Low findings: 90 days
