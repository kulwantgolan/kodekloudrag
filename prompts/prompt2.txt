Based on the problems identified in rag_issues.md, create an improved RAG system that fixes all 4 issues:

1. **Smart Chunking**: Implement sentence-aware chunking with 512 tokens and 50 token overlap
2. **Metadata Filtering**: Extract AWS service, section, and policy IDs for each chunk
3. **Hybrid Search**: Combine 70% semantic + 30% keyword search with BM25
4. **Query Enhancement**: Add acronym expansion and synonym support

Create the improved system as /root/rag-debugging/improved_rag_system.py

Ensure the system:
- Uses tiktoken for proper token counting
- Implements BM25 for keyword search
- Extracts metadata for all AWS services
- Enhances queries with domain-specific terms
- Achieves 90%+ accuracy on the test cases
