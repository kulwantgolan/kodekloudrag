# RAG System Accuracy Issues Report

## Overview
The RAG system is achieving only 45% accuracy on compliance queries due to several fundamental flaws in its implementation.

## Main Problems

### 1. Poor Document Chunking Strategy
**What's Wrong:** The system uses a fixed-size chunking approach with 120-character chunks and 100-character step size, which frequently breaks sentences and semantic units mid-way.

**Impact on Accuracy:** Chunks often contain incomplete information, making it difficult for the retrieval system to find coherent, relevant responses. This leads to fragmented retrievals that don't provide complete answers to compliance queries.

**How to Fix:** Implement semantic chunking that respects sentence boundaries and document structure. Use libraries like LangChain's text splitters or spaCy for sentence-aware splitting, and consider hierarchical chunking for better context preservation.

### 2. Insufficient Metadata Extraction
**What's Wrong:** The system only stores basic metadata (source file name and chunk index) without extracting compliance-specific information like section headers, compliance standards, or document types.

**Impact on Accuracy:** Without rich metadata, the system cannot filter or prioritize results based on compliance relevance. For example, it can't distinguish between GDPR and HIPAA compliance sections, leading to irrelevant results.

**How to Fix:** Implement metadata extraction that parses document headers, identifies compliance standards (e.g., SOC 2, PCI DSS), and extracts key terms. Use regex patterns or NLP tools to identify and tag compliance-related sections.

### 3. Degraded Search Methodology
**What's Wrong:** The search function intentionally adds significant noise to query embeddings and limits results to only 1 document, severely degrading retrieval quality.

**Impact on Accuracy:** The noise reduces embedding similarity accuracy, while returning only one result dramatically lowers the chance of finding relevant information, especially for complex compliance queries that may require multiple sources.

**How to Fix:** Remove the noise addition, increase n_results to 5-10, and implement proper similarity scoring. Consider using hybrid search combining semantic and keyword-based retrieval for better accuracy.

### 4. Lack of Query Processing Enhancement
**What's Wrong:** Queries are processed directly without any enhancement, preprocessing, or expansion.

**Impact on Accuracy:** Users may use different terminology than the documents (e.g., "data privacy" vs "information protection"), and the system doesn't handle synonyms, acronyms, or query refinement, leading to poor matching.

**How to Fix:** Implement query expansion using synonym dictionaries, acronym resolution, and preprocessing steps like normalization. Consider using query rewriting or multi-query approaches to improve retrieval.

## Recommendations
1. Fix chunking to preserve semantic meaning
2. Enhance metadata for better filtering
3. Improve search quality and result diversity
4. Add query preprocessing and expansion
5. Implement evaluation metrics to measure improvements
