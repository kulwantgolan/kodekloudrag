# RAG System Accuracy Issues Report

## Overview
The RAG system is achieving only 45% accuracy on compliance queries due to several fundamental flaws in its implementation.

## Main Problems

### 1. Poor Document Chunking Strategy
**What's Wrong:** The system uses a fixed-size chunking approach with 120-character chunks and 100-character step size, which frequently breaks sentences and semantic units mid-way.

**Impact on Accuracy:** Chunks often contain incomplete information, making it difficult for the retrieval system to find coherent, relevant responses. This leads to fragmented retrievals that don't provide complete answers to compliance queries.

**How to Fix:** Implement semantic chunking that respects sentence boundaries and document structure. Use libraries like LangChain's text splitters or spaCy for sentence-aware splitting, and consider hierarchical chunking for better context preservation.

### 2. Insufficient Metadata Extraction
**What's Wrong:** The system only stores basic metadata (source file name and chunk index) without extracting compliance-specific information like section headers, compliance standards, or document types.

**Impact on Accuracy:** Without rich metadata, the system cannot filter or prioritize results based on compliance relevance. For example, it can't distinguish between GDPR and HIPAA compliance sections, leading to irrelevant results.

**How to Fix:** Implement metadata extraction that parses document headers, identifies compliance standards (e.g., SOC 2, PCI DSS), and extracts key terms. Use regex patterns or NLP tools to identify and tag compliance-related sections.

### 3. Degraded Search Methodology
**What's Wrong:** The search function intentionally adds significant noise to query embeddings and limits results to only 1 document, severely degrading retrieval quality.

**Impact on Accuracy:** The noise reduces embedding similarity accuracy, while returning only one result dramatically lowers the chance of finding relevant information, especially for complex compliance queries that may require multiple sources.

**How to Fix:** Remove the noise addition, increase n_results to 5-10, and implement proper similarity scoring. Consider using hybrid search combining semantic and keyword-based retrieval for better accuracy.

### 4. Lack of Query Processing Enhancement
**What's Wrong:** Queries are processed directly without any enhancement, preprocessing, or expansion.

**Impact on Accuracy:** Users may use different terminology than the documents (e.g., "data privacy" vs "information protection"), and the system doesn't handle synonyms, acronyms, or query refinement, leading to poor matching.

**How to Fix:** Implement query expansion using synonym dictionaries, acronym resolution, and preprocessing steps like normalization. Consider using query rewriting or multi-query approaches to improve retrieval.

## Recommendations
1. Fix chunking to preserve semantic meaning
2. Enhance metadata for better filtering
3. Improve search quality and result diversity
4. Add query preprocessing and expansion
5. Implement evaluation metrics to measure improvements

# RAG System Issues Analysis

## Current Accuracy: 45%

## Main Problems

### 1. Document Chunking Strategy

**What's wrong:** The system uses fixed-size chunks of 120 characters with a step size of 100, which often breaks text mid-sentence and creates overlapping fragments that lack semantic coherence.

**Why it impacts accuracy:** Compliance queries require complete context (e.g., full policy descriptions or requirements). Fragmented chunks mean that critical information is split across multiple pieces, and the search may retrieve only partial answers that don't contain all required terms in a single result.

**How to fix it:** Implement semantic chunking using sentence or paragraph boundaries, with larger chunks (500-1000 characters) that preserve complete thoughts. Use libraries like LangChain's text splitters or spaCy for better segmentation.

### 2. Metadata Extraction

**What's wrong:** Only basic metadata is stored: the source filename and chunk index. No extraction of document structure, section titles, policy IDs, or key terms.

**Why it impacts accuracy:** Without rich metadata, the system can't filter or prioritize results based on relevance (e.g., retrieving chunks from the correct policy section). This leads to lower precision in retrieval.

**How to fix it:** Extract structured metadata during processing, such as document titles, section headers, policy IDs, and keywords. Use regex or NLP tools to identify and store this information, enabling metadata-based filtering in searches.

### 3. Search Methodology

**What's wrong:** The search intentionally adds Gaussian noise to query embeddings and limits results to only 1 instead of the requested number, significantly degrading retrieval quality.

**Why it impacts accuracy:** Noise reduces embedding similarity accuracy, and returning only one result limits the chance of finding correct information, especially since the evaluator requires all must-have terms in a single result.

**How to fix it:** Remove noise addition, return the full requested number of results, and consider using hybrid search (combining semantic and keyword-based retrieval) for better accuracy.

### 4. Query Processing

**What's wrong:** Queries are processed with no enhancement, preprocessing, or expansionâ€”just direct embedding.

**Why it impacts accuracy:** Compliance queries often use specific terminology or abbreviations. Without normalization, synonym expansion, or cleaning, the system misses relevant documents that use different but equivalent terms.

**How to fix it:** Implement query preprocessing: normalize text (lowercase, remove punctuation), expand with synonyms or related terms, and use query rewriting techniques to improve matching.
